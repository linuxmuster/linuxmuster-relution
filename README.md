# linuxmuster-relution

linuxmuster.net scripts and configuration files to setup a relution mdm docker container using [relution/relution](https://hub.docker.com/r/relution/relution/) provided by [relution.io](https://live.relution.io/).  

After installation open the server admin console on _https://\<hostname\>:8443_ and login as user _admin_ with password _admin123_ (see [relution installation guide](http://repo.relution.io/package/latest/installguide.pdf)).

Uses [linuxmuster-ngingx-proxy](https://github.com/linuxmuster/linuxmuster-nginx-proxy) as reverse proxy providing ssl connection.
